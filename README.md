## Interview
EMIND is a multi-functional AI music recommendation and generation system designed to deliver the best music experience through sentiment analysis and personalized recommendations. The system integrates a variety of functions, including text to music, lyrics to melody, voice synthesis, timbre conversion, accompaniment generation, music classification, music separation and lyrics recognition. Using deep learning and multimodal analysis techniques, it is able to generate matching music based on the user's mood. The system uses LLM as the intellectual brain of the system to complete complex music tasks through interaction with local code. It's essentially an AI agent.

## Get Stared 
Before you get Started the project,you need to ensure you have the below conditation:
1. Ubuntu 18.04
2. python 3.9
3. CUDA10.2
   
then you can install the necessray packages according to the requremnents.txt
Finally I guess the hardest part of the following is that you need to download a lot of models from the open source community!
In order to achieve melody generation you need to doï¼š
firstly, you need to change to models floder.the path is defaule in the project.
then you can do this.  
1>Download the checkpoint and database from the following link.  
2>Place the downloaded checkpoint file in the music-ckpt folder.  
3>Create a folder named database to store the downloaded database files
